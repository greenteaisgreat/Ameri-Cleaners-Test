        question: "How long does tailoring take?",
        answer: "If you want to get things done as quickly as possible, call ahead for an appointment. Appointment duration for fittings can vary a lot, depending on the article of clothing. A wedding dress can take 45 minutes to an hour, while a pair of suit pants can be fitted in less than ten minutes."

        question: "What are the benefits of dry cleaning?",
        answer: "Dry cleaning is a very effective cleaning process that can remove stains and dirt from clothing and other fabrics without risking shrinkage or damage. Traditional laundry services, using soap and water, can shrink, damage, or discolor clothing, while dry cleaning just cleans while protecting the clothing. For some fabrics and garments, dry cleaning is the only safe option."
    },
    {
        id: "faq-3",
        question: "Do you use any hazardous or polluting cleaning products?",
        answer: "No. We use environmentally-friendly, totally biodegradable soaps and conditioners to get your garments clean without negatively affecting the environment. We can safely clean “dry clean only” items without the harmful solvents and chemicals that are often used by other dry cleaners."
    },
    {
        id: "faq-4",
        question: "Does frequent dry cleaning shorten the life of a garment?",
        answer: "No. On the contrary, dry cleaning actually extends the life of garments, because unlike water washing, dry cleaning does not slowly degrade the quality of the clothing. Instead, it removes dirt and stains, and can restore and preserve the integrity of the garment."
